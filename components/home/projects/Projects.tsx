          Twither is a fullstack application that supports a majority of the
          same features as Twitter.
        </p>
        <p>
          Using NextAuth, users can register for an account and login to use the
          app. Users can tweet, follow other users, like, comment, and upload
          images for their profiles.
        </p>
        <p>
          The layout of the app is responsive and shows the appropriate
          components depending on whether the user's device is on mobile or
          desktop.
        </p>
        <p>
          All data is updated in real time using Prisma and MongoDB and
          sensitive information such as passwords are hashed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, the app is deployed on Vercel and any updated are done by
          pushing to the Github repository associated with the deployment.

        <p>
          As the President of the Andrews Filipino International Association I
          wanted a new way to engage with members. So I built this digital
          scavenger hunt app as a fun way for them to win prizes and attend
          events.
        </p>
        <p>
          The idea is that, in conjunction with social events, users can enter
          secret keys and unlock special pages that contain valuable
          information.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tech stack is based on top of React using Vite and hosted on AWS
          Amplify so users have a smooth experience. However, a backup of this
          project is on Vercel because support on AWS continues to change.
        </p>
        <p>
          The app is fully responsive and uses several fundamentals of React
          such as useState, Props, and Component rendering.

          As artificial intelligence becomes more popular I want to learn the
          mysteries behind the black box of machine learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          To learn more I'm taking this course on Coursera to learn more about
          how machine learning works. I will built a project that showcases what
          I've learned and hopefully I can share it here soon.
