              Hey! I&apos;m Dawson, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I started my coding journey as a computer science student at
              Andrews University. I specialize in full stack development,
              primarily React, Next.JS, and MongoDB, but love building with
              whatever tools are right for the job.
            </p>

              I currently work for Advent Share Ministries as we're working to
              redesign their website. We're testing ways for users to donate to
              the organization through the website and updating current pages
              for a smoother experience.

              Outside of work, I love to play volleyball and improve my
              videography. These are my favorite passions that allow me to stay
              healthy and have a creative outlet ðŸŽ¥

              I&apos;m actively looking for new positions where I can
              collaborate through code and learn new things. If you think
              you&apos;ve got an opening where I might fit, let&apos;s connect
