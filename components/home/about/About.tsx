              Hey! I&apos;m Dawson, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I started my coding journey as a computer science student at
              Andrews University. I specialize in full stack development,
              primarily React, Next.JS, and AWS, but love building with whatever
              tools are right for the job.
            </p>

            <p className={styles.aboutText}>
              I currently work as a software engineer intern at Warner Bros.
              Discovery. I&apos;m building an internal tool that is used to
              enable easier communication between different teams inside the
              organization.

              Outside of work, I love to play volleyball and film videos with my
              friends. These are my favorite passions that allow me to stay
              healthy and have a creative outlet ðŸŽ¥

              Currently I&apos;m focused on making the most out of my internship
              and learning as much as I can from everyone around me. If
              you&apos;d like to chat, exchange stories, or make a new friend,
              let&apos;s connect ðŸ”—
